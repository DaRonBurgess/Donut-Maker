                            <br>
                        Fred the Baker Baking Company is a family owned company that was established in 1936. The company was started by Fred Jones when he opened his first bakery in Columbus, Ohio. It started off as a local bakery with not much traffic until one day Fred's life changed forever. On June 5th, 1936 president Franklin D. Roosevelt walked into Fred's bakery and fell in love. The publicity from that presidential visit sent Fred's baking company spirally into success. The company is now owned and operated by Fred's great grandson Fred Jones &#8546; and to this day remains famous for being the bakery that inspired the creation of national donut day.</p>
